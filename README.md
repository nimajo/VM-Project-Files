# VM-Project-Files
Hosted my portfolio website on an Azure Windows Server VM using IIS with secure NSG configuration.


This project demonstrates the deployment and configuration of a secure web server environment on Microsoft Azure. I provisioned a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine, configured networking components, and implemented security best practices using Network Security Groups (NSGs) with IP‑restricted inbound rules for RDP (3389) and HTTP (80).

Inside the VM, I installed and configured Internet Information Services (IIS), replaced the default web root with a custom portfolio website, and validated external access through the VM’s public IP. I also created additional static pages to demonstrate routing and content hosting.

This project showcases practical experience with Azure VM provisioning, NSG configuration, Windows Server administration, IIS management, and secure web hosting.
